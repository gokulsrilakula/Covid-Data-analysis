# Laptop-Price-Predictor
It's a Machine Learning Project which can predict about the price of the Laptop when you provide your required configuration. The data set which I used for this project is available over kaggle & here's the link --> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammetvarl/laptop-price You can download this dataSet and apply EDA and feature engineering according to your knowledge else I did the most best which we can get from this small dataset.The Prediction I am getting is also overall good & justable. 

Below image shows the workflow of the prediction model

This project mainly consists of web application that integrated by a machine learning model which will be able to make a prediction of laptopsâ€™ prices based on their key features(Brand, ram, PPI, Typename etc). Web application will facilitate people in choosing the components they need , and they could obtain an idea about what will be the expected price of the laptop they want.


This is the User Interface of the End-to-End project where you can specify the features for price prediction.

You just need to have a good knowledge of python and machine learning if you want to do this project you can easily do this.Below are the steps to execute the project by your own
1.Download the Datasets and the files from from this Github repository .
2.Store all the related files in the same location.
3.Open Jupyter notebook and load the Laptop_Price_Predictor.ipynb file and execute all the commands.
4.Open Pycharm and execute the app.py file.
5.Go to the terminal tab and execte the command streamlit run app.py
6.A new tab will be opened on the browser.
7.Input the desired features and click on recommend button.
8.The price will be dispalyed.
